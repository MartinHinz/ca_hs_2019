## What is a Database?

- A (typically very large) integrated collection of data.
- Typically models a real-world situation:
  - Entities (e.g., teams, games)
  - Relationships (e.g. The A’s are playing in the World Series)
- Computerised database systems are now very commonplace
- Information is stored in a database every time we: 
  - use a bank account
  - book a travel ticket
  - make an appointment with a doctor
  - etc.
- To actually store the data, and to do anything useful with it, you need a Database Management System (DBMS)

## DBMS

.pull-left[
- Microsoft Access
  - aimed at small businesses, and useful for desktop applications and systems with a small number of users
- Microsoft SQL Server, Oracle, IDM DB2
  - scalable and professional, and widely used by large organisations
- MySQL, PostgreSQL
  - open-source and quite powerful, widely used in web sites
- JavaDB, SQLite
  - compact DBMSs, suitable for mobile devices in particular
- ...and many more

## Data models

- The way in which data is organised for storage in a database is known as the data model 
- Early computer databases developed in the 1960’s used a hierarchical model, similar to the way files and folders are still organised in computer file systems
- Most data does not fit very well into a simple hierarchy

“Real-world” data – no clear hierarchy

- Relatively complex data like this is better handled with the relational model
- Most databases nowadays are relational databases
  - although there are others: object databases, XML databases, “NoSQL” databases
