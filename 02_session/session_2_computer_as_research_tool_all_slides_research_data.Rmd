### Where to put stuff so you won’t lose it 

.pull-left[
- Logical to you – and easily understandable to others

- Ease of sharing / exchange of data

- Maintaining retrieval of files, e.g. Esri shape files (multiple files)

- Defining the ‘end product’ of a project helps maintain file structure

&nbsp;

- Distinguish between projects.

- Distinguish between sub-folders.

- Define ‘end-product’ of research – and keep clean of temporary folder and files.

- Research designs change and so must file structure.

- Avoid overuse of folders – easier said than done though.

- rule of thumb: 7 subfolders, if more, structure deeper

## `r icon::fa("file-signature")` File Naming<sup>*</sup>

.pull-left[
What to call stuff so you know what it is

- Names tell us what a file is:	 Contextual information.

- Names order files:		 Making stuff easy to find.

- Define your system:		 **And stick to it.**

---

## `r icon::fa("file-signature")` File Naming<sup>*</sup> (suggestions)

First: Define the types of data and file formats for the research. 
.pull-left[
- Different data may require different naming conventions:
  - Should different data/file formats be identified as part of same project?

- Examples of contextual information in file names: 
  - Date, Author or Initials, Site or Project, Material.

- Capitals in file names affect ordering – be consistent.

]
.pull-right[
- Numbers order files only if zeros are used before units and tens:
  - 001, 002, 003, etc will order files up to 999.
  
- Dates are useful for version control and ordering files.
  - YY-MM-DD (11-03-02) at end of name orders files of same name by year.
  - Year first is good for ordering files, e.g. publication pdfs

- Spaces between file names cause havoc in GIS. Use_underscores

- / Forwardslashes / in file names can cause problems too.

- CAPITALS ARE HARD TO READ!

## `r icon::fa("code-branch")` Version Control<sup>*</sup>
### Keeping track of stuff

It’s surprisingly easy to lose track of the current version of a file.

Especially:
- Word file drafts of thesis chapters.
- Word files commented on by others.
- Multiple-author files sent back and forth by e-mail.
- Graphics and AutoCAD files.

- Be consistent with up-dating file names: version number, initials, date.
- Put old versions in separate “Archive” folder (with date of that version in the folder name)
- Possibly delete old drafts when final version is finished.

## `r icon::fa("file-code")` File Formats<sup>*</sup>
### What to save stuff in so it’s safe


- Facilitate exchange of data

- Ease of working on different computers / software packages

- Preserve data for re-use in the future

## Archiving Text Files<sup>*</sup>
.footnote[.tiny[<sup>*</sup> adapted from presentation 'Working with Digital Data' (Lindsay Lloyd-Smith 2011)]]

- Complete, self explanatory and self contained files.
- Retain embedded data (images, tables) and save in suitable format in a parallel folder.
- No external links to material outside of document.

### Significant Properties of Text Files
- Words and word order.
- Correct script for non-English words.
- Hierarchical structure: headings and sub-headings.
- Formatting: italicised and bold text (but not font type).
- Page numbering.
- Non-text content: images, tabular data stored separately. 

---
## Digital Images<sup>*</sup>
.footnote[.tiny[<sup>*</sup> adapted from presentation 'Working with Digital Data' (Lindsay Lloyd-Smith 2011)]]

- Images are used to convey information and support interpretations.
- Images contain data and are often analysed to reach interpretations.
- Images are one of the most important formats of digital data in archaeology.
- Image documentation and preservation is key for future re-use of project archives.
- Digital images often form the largest part of digital archives.

- **Raster Images:** matrix of dots/pixels containing information (photographs, scans) 
- **Vector Images:** formed by points, lines, polylines, polygons represented by co-ordinates and mathematical formulae (graphic - illustrations, CAD, GIS)

---
## Routes to Rasters<sup>*</sup>
.footnote[.tiny[<sup>*</sup> adapted from presentation 'Working with Digital Data' (Lindsay Lloyd-Smith 2011)]]

- Scanned images of paper illustration or photograph.
- Digitally captured or created: cameras or digitally created illustrations
- Output product of other digital applications: vector, CAD, or GIS work, or geophysical survey data, etc.

- Think of the purpose of image when making it: 
  - screen, print or reference image.
- Formats have different qualities which affect their output use and preservation.

---
## Routes to Rasters<sup>*</sup>
.footnote[.tiny[<sup>*</sup> adapted from presentation 'Working with Digital Data' (Lindsay Lloyd-Smith 2011)]]

.small[
**Resolution** / Level of detail in image:
- Pixels per inch (PPI) or Dots per inch (DPI) or Samples per inch (SPI)
- Bigger the physical size of the picture + increased resolution = bigger file size
- min. 600 dpi for photographs and 300 for illustrations.

**Bit (Colour) Depth** / Level of colour information:
- 2 Bit   = Black/White (line drawings with only black and white needed)
- 8 Bit   = Greyscale
- 24 Bit = Standard colour
- 32 Bit = High colour

**Colour Space** / Type of colour
- Bi-tonal = black/white
- Greyscale
- RGB (Red/Green/Blue) used for screen presentations. Cameras generally capture images in RGB.
- CMYK (Cyan/ Magenta/Yellow /Key [Black]) used for printing colour images.

**Compression**
- Non-compressed (Lossless): GIF, PNG, TIFF.
- Compressed: JPG

Some formats (TIFF, PNG) allow files to be saved as non-compressed.
Important to be aware of when compression is occurring and at what level.

**Image layering**
Layering is NOT supported in final raster image and layers will be merged into a single layer from top down.

## Raster Files<sup>*</sup>
### key points
.footnote[.tiny[<sup>*</sup> adapted from presentation 'Working with Digital Data' (Lindsay Lloyd-Smith 2011)]]

- Think of purpose of image.
- Document rationale of image creation.
- Maintain image documentation: 
- Image properties, file naming and image description file.
- If working with JPEGs, save original as archive and work on copies.
- Save working copies of raster outputs of vector files and replace with final version.

---
## Vector File Formats<sup>*</sup>
.footnote[.tiny[<sup>*</sup> adapted from presentation 'Working with Digital Data' (Lindsay Lloyd-Smith 2011)]]

- Variety of proprietary and open-source software for producing vector images, none of which is recommended for long-term - archiving:
  - Coreldraw (.cdr); Adobe Illustrator (.ai); OpenOffice Draw (.odg).

- Think of purpose of vector files and the output.

Illustrations:
- Save output in high quality TIFF or PNG format.

Files with important vector information:
- Document layer conventions
- Export as SVG file (Scalable Vector Graphics)
- PDF files also holds vector data.

## CAD & GIS<sup>*</sup>
.footnote[.tiny[<sup>*</sup> adapted from presentation 'Working with Digital Data' (Lindsay Lloyd-Smith 2011)]]

- Used to make figures of real world entities: site plans, maps, building plans, etc. 
- Files comprise layers – turned on or off depending what is required.  


**CAD**	Computer Aided Design	(eg. AutoCAD)
- Developed as technical drafting tool for precise geometric objects.
- Layers connected to data tables – but can not be analysed.


**GIS**	Geographical Information System (eg. QGIS)
- Links graphic objects (points, areas on maps, etc) to associated data tables.
- Geographical analyses can be performed on data tables.

## CAD & GIS<sup>*</sup>
.footnote[.tiny[<sup>*</sup> adapted from presentation 'Working with Digital Data' (Lindsay Lloyd-Smith 2011)]]

**Common Data Management Issues**
- Document methods of data caption or collection
- Document terms and conventions used for the layers. 
- Record processes carried out on the data in work log:
  - Date; Process [history function in GIS]; Purpose; Output

**Common Archiving Issues**
- Proprietary software that is not backwardly compatible. Migrate!
- Retain raw survey data.
- Digital exchange formats (DXF, SVG).

## Spreadsheets and Databases: Overview<sup>*</sup>
.footnote[.tiny[<sup>*</sup> adapted from presentation 'Working with Digital Data' (Lindsay Lloyd-Smith 2011)]]

**Spreadsheets: **
	Designed on accounting worksheets, primarily for ordering numerical data, performing calculations, and produce charts and figures from data and calculations.

**Databases: **
	Designed to store a wide variety of data (numerical, text, images) and provide complex search and reporting on these data.


**What is important?**
- Data values themselves
- Structure of the tables/sheets used to store
- Structure of relationships between tables in database

### Data Management

.footnote[.tiny[<sup>*</sup> adapted from presentation 'Working with Digital Data' (Lindsay Lloyd-Smith 2011)]]

**Data consistency**
- Standardised data entry is essential.
- Methods for controlled data entry recommended.
- File and field name and codes need to be documented in separate file.
- Document relationships of database tables (screen shot as jpeg)

**Embedded objects**
- Embedded objects (images, charts, figures) stored separately.
- Document analysis/search procedures from which figures are produced.
- Embedded objects removed from final archived file.

**Non-data content (presentation formatting)**
- Document formatting of tabular data (fonts, colours, cell borders, etc).
- Document data input forms and search query results (‘reports’).

## `r icon::fa("passport")` Documentation and Metadata<sup>*</sup>
### Letting others understand your data

.footnote[.tiny[<sup>*</sup> adapted from presentation 'Working with Digital Data' (Lindsay Lloyd-Smith 2011)]]

**Project Documentation**
- Methodology Chapter of Thesis: general information, standards used, etc.
- Introduction / Guide to Appendices: detailed technical information, e.g. explanation of file names and formats used, methods and standards of digital data capture (scanning settings etc).

**Individual File Documentation: embedded or stored separately.**
- Descriptive data on images, audio-visual files, etc.
- Explanation of headings, codes, structure and format of spreadsheets and databases.
- Explanation of vector file layers.

**CAD and GIS Documentation**
- Keep a log of changes to file data and procedures carried out in GIS.

## `r icon::fa("recycle")` Selection<sup>*</sup>
### Chucking stuff away!

- Should we keep everything?
- Define the core data which will form the project archive.
- Keep the core data clean.
- Can we keep hold of data that other people send us?
- Chuck stuff away during the project.
- Try not to hoard multiple versions of the same file.
- Store earlier drafts in separate folder as back-up.
- Delete draft documents when file is finalised.
- Draft research proposals may be useful to refer to later.
- What to do with e-mails?
