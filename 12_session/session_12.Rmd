## GPS

.pull-left[
### Operating principle

Satellite systems are needed to determine a geographical position, to navigate in the terrain or to determine the exact time. Various systems are available worldwide, such as NAVSTAR-GPS (currently in operation), GLONASS or the planned GALILEO. All positioning and navigation systems are combined under the name GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite Systems).

## GPS

.pull-left[
### Operating principle

To receive signals you need a receiver that can receive signals from at least four satellites simultaneously. The receiver then calculates the four signal propagation times (from the satellites to the receiving antenna). From this, the current position (including altitude) and the exact receiver time are determined. The exact location can be determined with an accuracy of approx. 12m to 1mm. The time (world time: UTC) will be recorded with an accuracy of 40ns to approx. 5ns.

The output then gives the latitude, longitude, altitude and time (with at least four satellites).

## dGPS

.pull-left[
### Reference station

The DGPS uses fixed GNSS antennas, so-called reference stations, whose exact position was determined by classical surveying methods. The actual propagation times of the signals for each satellite can be determined very precisely from the deviation of the actual and the received position. The differences of the theoretical and the actual signal propagation times are transmitted to the DGPS receivers in the environment.

## dGPS

.pull-left[
### DGPS Receiver

The DGPS receivers correct their position with these correction signals, which allows the position of the receiver to be calculated much more accurately. The receiving antenna required for the correction signals is often integrated into the GNSS antennas. If the (radio/Internet) connection to the DGPS transmitter fails, the receiver switches to the uncorrected GNSS mode with normal accuracy.

## dGPS

.pull-left[
### accuracy

- depends mainly on the distance to the DGPS receiver from the reference station
- the achievable accuracy lies between 0.3 m and 2.5 m for the position (x, y) and at 0.2 m to 5 m for the height
- High-quality systems additionally evaluate the phase shift of the carrier wave and achieve accuracies of a few millimetres (± 1 mm to ± 10 mm per km distance from the reference system).

### correction signals

- correction data can be generated by the user himself with a second GPS receiver
- many countries have set up permanent reference stations
- allows high-precision positioning in real time, even with just one receiver.

### before: Level (Nivelliergerät)

- Telescope that can be rotated around the vertical axis to create a horizontal target line.
- This can be used to determine height differences, as well as:
  - Horizontal circle: staking out right angle
  - Measurement of optical distances (accuracy of 10-30 cm)
- Compensator: mirror suspended from threads, which directs the horizontal light beam to the centre of the cross-hairs despite the residual inclination
